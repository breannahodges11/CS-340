•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing modular code is the best approach for maintainable, readable, and adaptable code.  With all the functions and classes in main it is much more difficult to edit and read.  

•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The first thing I do is to get a clear picture of what is wanted.  I like to take notes and figure out the best way to approach each requirement.  I write in blocks of code, then test that section before moving on to the next.  If I don’t do this, it is much harder to find where a problem might be and it tends to take much longer to finish it.

•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

To put it plainly, computer scientists are problem solvers.  We make people’s and organization’s lives easier by creating solutions to problems they are facing.  This program would save the organization a lot of time and money by automating a system to sort these animals.  This program can easily comb through thousands of records in seconds, which would take a very long time to do by hand.
